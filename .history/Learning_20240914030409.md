# Next.js

## What is Next.js?

- Next.js is a React framework for building web applications.
- When building an application with React alone, it's not feasible to create a fully-featured application ready for production.
- React is a library for building user interfaces.
- You need to make decisions about other features such as routing, data fetching and more.

- Next.js is a React framework that uses React for building user interfaces.
- It provides additional features that enable you to build production-ready applications.
- These features include:
  - routing
  - optimized rendering
  - data fetching
  - building
  - compiling
  - etc
- You don't need to install additional packages as Next.js provides everything you need.
- Next.js as a framework has opinions and conventions that should be followed to implement these features.

## Why learn Next.js?

- Next.js simplifies the process of building a web application for production.
  - routing
  - API routes
  - rendering - leads to better SEO
  - Data fetching
  - Styling
  - Optimization
  - Dev and prod build system

## React Server Components (RSC)

- React Server Components is a new architecture introduced by the React team in version 18 which was quickly embraced by Next.js
- The architecture introduces a new way of creating React components, splitting them into two types:
  - Server components
  - Client components

- Server components:
  - In Next.js, all components are Server components by default.
  - They have the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database.
  - However, they don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions.

- Client components
  - To create a Client component, it's necessary to add "use client" at the top of the component file.
  - Client components can't perform tasks like reading files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions.

## React Server Components and Routing

- We'll explore examples where we use server components that await certain actions to finalize before rendering content on the screen.
- We'll also see examples where we use client components to leverage hooks from the routing module.

## Routing

- Next.js has a file-system based routing mechanism.
- URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase.

### Routing conventions

- All routes must be placed inside the app folder
- Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx
- Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL

- File Based Routing
- We need 2 additional routes
- Nested routes
- Dynamic Routes - Dynamic routes segment
- Nested Dynamic routes
